Import and Sync properties from the Respacio CRM.

== Description ==

Manage all your property listings and contacts from Respacio to take your real estate sales and marketing to the next level. From multinational franchises to sole traders, the Respacio CRM is used by successful real estate agents and developers all over the world to sell and rent properties. 

This plugin is designed to import your properties into the Respacio CRM and then feed them back to your Houzez website, allowing you to manage your properties from within the Respacio CRM. The plugin makes changes to the content of data tables in your Wordpress installation. It does not affect the Houzez theme design, functionality, CSS or any other element of your site. 

Not only can you sync properties to your Houzez website, but with Respacio you can connect multiple websites in any languages and currencies, each with its own Top Level Domain (TLD eg .com, .es, .pt, .fr) allowing you build the perfect SEO structure.

Respacio will also feed properties out to property portals such as Rightmove, Zoopla, Kyero or systems like Facebook to create a property catalogue... using the Feedbuilder module you can connect synchronise XML and JSON feeds to almost anywhere. This means you can also feed in properties directly from partner agents, MLS systems etc and then feed these properties out to your websites. You can also apply feeds to contacts.

New enquiries from websites, property portals and other online sources enter your Respacio system automatically, no typing using the API, Plugins or automated inbuilt email reader. Respacio comes with hundreds of possible automations to speed up your business flow.

Team management, pipelines, deals, GSuite integration, emails, calendars, newsletters, reports: Respacio allows real estate businesses to take control, measure and refine their digital marketing and sales processes.
